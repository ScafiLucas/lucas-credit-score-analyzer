# Credit Score Analyzer (Portifolio)

This is a full-stack portfolio project focused on Quality Engineering, Test Automation, DevOps, and AI. The goal is to demonstrate senior-level technical skills by delivering a complete system architecture including:

- FastAPI-based backend (Python)
- Async processing with queues and cloud services
- Minimal front-end for E2E test scenarios
- Automated test coverage (unit, component, contract, performance, security)
- CI/CD pipelines with rollback and dynamic test containers
- AI-driven unit test generation using OpenAI API
